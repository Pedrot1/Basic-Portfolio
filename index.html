                My name is Pedro Tazza, im a Bartender and Amazon employee who also drives for Uber during free time.
I'm a son of two immigrants who traveled here from Peru at young ages and met here. Being raised in the hispanic 
culture shows you a ton of diversity amongst all the people near our country. All my work ethic was taught to me 
by my grandfather who work any and all jobs no matter the difficulty or the pay. My family, like so many, sacrificed alot
to allow me to accomplish more in life.
